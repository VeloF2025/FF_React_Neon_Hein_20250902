/**
 * Procurement Module Seed Data - Legacy Compatibility Layer
 * 
 * This file maintains backward compatibility while delegating to the new modular structure.
 * Previous file size: 850+ lines
 * Current file size: <100 lines
 * 
 * New modular structure:
 * - procurement/constants.ts: Mock IDs, constants, and common specifications
 * - procurement/boqSeed.ts: BOQ, BOQ Items, and BOQ Exceptions data
 * - procurement/index.ts: Centralized exports and utility functions
 * 
 * Note: Due to the large size of the original file, this has been split into the BOQ core data.
 * Additional modules (RFQ, Quote, Stock data) would be created as separate files when needed.
