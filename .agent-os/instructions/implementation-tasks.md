2. BOQ Import â†’ BOQ UI â†’ RFQ Creation
3. Stock Movements â†’ Drum Tracking â†’ Reporting

### Parallel Tasks (Independent Components)
- Supplier Portal (Task 4.x) || Stock Management (Task 5.x)
- UI Components || API Endpoints (when specs are clear)
- Testing || Documentation (for completed features)

### Hybrid Coordination Points
- **After Phase 1**: Architecture review and approval
- **After Phase 3**: Core functionality testing
- **After Phase 5**: Integration testing and optimization
- **Before Production**: Security audit and performance testing

This task breakdown provides clear assignments for the ForgeFlow (@FF) multi-agent system to efficiently develop the Procurement Portal Module.
