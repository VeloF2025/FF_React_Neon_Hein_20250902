## üéØ PROJECT WORKFLOW TASK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

**Priority:** P1-HIGH
**Type:** Feature Implementation  
**Module:** Project Management
**Epic:** Project Lifecycle Management

## üìã Overview

Implement a comprehensive project workflow task management system based on the legacy Angular application analysis. This system provides structured project progression through predefined workflow phases with mandatory task completion tracking.

## üîç **Legacy Analysis Complete**

Based on analysis of `C:\Jarvis\AI Workspace\FibreFlow_Firebase`, the system implements:

- **4-Tier Hierarchy:** Project ‚Üí Phase ‚Üí Step ‚Üí Task
- **192 Predefined Tasks** across 5 main phases
- **Template-Based Workflow** ensuring project consistency
- **Advanced Task Features:** Progress tracking, dependencies, time tracking, assignments

**Full Analysis:** See `LEGACY_TASK_MANAGEMENT_ANALYSIS.md`

## üèóÔ∏è **System Architecture**

### **Workflow Phases (5 Main Phases)**
1. **Planning Phase** (96 tasks, 12 steps)
   - Commercial Planning, Legal Planning, Technical Planning
   - Site surveys, permits, resource allocation
   
2. **Initiate Project** (24 tasks, 6 steps)  
   - Project kickoff, team formation
   - Initial setup and preparation
   
3. **Work in Progress** (24 tasks, 6 steps)
   - Active implementation and development
   - Progress monitoring and adjustments
   
4. **Handover** (24 tasks, 6 steps)
   - System delivery and knowledge transfer
   - Documentation and training
   
5. **Full Acceptance** (24 tasks, 6 steps)
   - Final testing and validation  
   - Project closure and sign-off

### **Task Management Features**
- **Task Assignment & Reassignment** with audit trails
- **Progress Tracking** (0-100% completion)
- **Priority Management** (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
- **Task Dependencies** and relationships
- **Time Tracking** (estimated vs actual hours)
- **Status Management** with workflow states
- **Template System** for automatic task creation

## üéØ **Implementation Requirements**

### **Phase 1: Database Schema (Days 1-2)**
- [ ] **Create task management tables** in Neon PostgreSQL
  - `project_phases` - 5 main workflow phases
  - `project_steps` - 32 workflow steps  
  - `project_tasks` - 192 task templates
  - `project_task_instances` - Actual project tasks
  - `task_assignments` - User assignments with history
  - `task_dependencies` - Task relationship mapping

- [ ] **Implement data relationships**
  - Phase ‚Üí Steps ‚Üí Tasks hierarchy
  - Project ‚Üí Task instances mapping
  - User assignments and permissions
  - Task dependencies and prerequisites

### **Phase 2: Backend Services (Days 3-4)**
- [ ] **Task Management Service**
  - CRUD operations for tasks
  - Template instantiation for new projects
  - Progress calculation and rollup
  - Assignment management with notifications

- [ ] **Workflow Engine Service**  
  - Phase progression validation
  - Dependency checking and enforcement
  - Automatic status updates
  - Workflow state management

- [ ] **API Endpoints**
  - `/api/projects/{id}/tasks` - Get project tasks
  - `/api/tasks/{id}/assign` - Assign/reassign tasks
  - `/api/tasks/{id}/progress` - Update task progress
  - `/api/workflows/phases` - Get workflow templates

### **Phase 3: React Components (Days 5-7)**
- [ ] **Task Management Dashboard**
  - Project workflow overview
  - Phase completion visualization  
  - Task progress tracking
  - Team workload overview

- [ ] **Task Detail Components**
  - Individual task management
  - Assignment interface
  - Progress updates and notes
  - Time tracking integration

- [ ] **Workflow Visualization**
  - Phase progression tracker
  - Gantt chart for project timeline
  - Dependency graph visualization
  - Critical path highlighting

### **Phase 4: Integration & Testing (Days 8-9)**  
- [ ] **Project Integration**
  - Auto-create tasks when project created
  - Link to existing project management
  - User role and permission integration
  - Notification system integration

- [ ] **Testing & Validation**
  - Unit tests for all task services
  - Integration tests for workflow engine
  - E2E tests for complete workflows
  - Performance testing with large task sets

## ‚úÖ **Success Criteria**

### **Functional Requirements**
- [ ] **Complete workflow implemented** with all 5 phases
- [ ] **192 task templates** available and working
- [ ] **Automatic task creation** when project initialized
- [ ] **Task assignment system** with user notifications
- [ ] **Progress tracking** with visual indicators
- [ ] **Dependency management** preventing invalid progression
- [ ] **Phase gates** requiring completion before progression

### **Business Impact**
- **Standardized Project Execution** - Consistent workflow across all projects
- **Improved Project Visibility** - Real-time progress tracking and reporting
- **Enhanced Team Coordination** - Clear task assignments and dependencies
- **Better Resource Management** - Workload distribution and capacity planning
