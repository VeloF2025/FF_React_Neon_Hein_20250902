## üéØ PURPOSE & GOALS

### Mission Statement
Implement a comprehensive, project-scoped procurement portal module within the FibreFlow_React application that transforms Excel BOQs into structured RFQs, orchestrates supplier collaboration, and provides full material traceability from supplier to site.

### Strategic Objectives
1. **Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with existing FibreFlow_React architecture
2. **Performance**: Achieve <250ms API response times for all procurement operations
3. **Security**: Implement RBAC with project-level isolation
4. **Usability**: Provide intuitive UI following FibreFlow design system
5. **Scalability**: Support horizontal scaling with project-based partitioning
