## Key Issues Fixed
1. **TypeScript Build Errors**: All fixed
   - Unused variables prefixed with underscore
   - Optional properties handled with defaults
   - Commented out incomplete implementations

2. **PoleTracker Migration**: Successfully migrated to Neon
   - Now using `sow_poles`, `sow_drops`, `sow_fibre` tables
   - Handles 50,000+ poles scale requirement
   - Photos remain in Firebase Storage

3. **Navigation Issues**: All resolved
   - Projects page crash fixed (React import issue)
   - Analytics using lighter component
   - Clients/Staff added to sidebar

## Database Architecture
### Firebase (Real-time)
- Authentication
- Photo storage
- Real-time updates
- User sessions

### Neon PostgreSQL (Scale)
- SOW data (poles, drops, fibre)
- Analytics data
- Historical records
- Reporting

## Next Steps
1. Test with real SOW data in Neon
2. Implement CSV import for 5000 poles per project
3. Set up photo upload to Firebase Storage
4. Optimize queries for 50,000+ records
5. Run Playwright E2E tests

## Build Information
```
Build Tool: Vite 4.5.14
TypeScript: Strict mode enabled
Bundle Size: 817.34 KB (largest chunk)
CSS: 69.54 KB
Total Modules: 14,462
Build Time: 39.60s

## Notes
- All routes are now accessible and rendering
- Data fetching uses React Query with proper error handling
- Lazy loading implemented for all route components
- Build warnings about chunk size can be addressed later with code splitting
