- API Layer: 85% (All contractor API endpoints)
- Database Layer: 90% (Schema and data integrity)
- Overall Project: 85% minimum

**Performance Gates**:
- Load Testing: 1000 concurrent users, <2s response
- Workflow Processing: Complete within 24h SLA
- Database Queries: <1s for paginated results
- Memory Usage: <500MB increase during bulk operations

**Security Gates**:
- All sensitive data encrypted (AES-256)
- TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- RBAC properly enforced
- All endpoints require authentication
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Virus scanning for all uploads

## Test Execution Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation Tests (Blocking Implementation)
**Duration**: 3-5 days
**Focus**: Critical path requirements that block any development

```bash
# Execute blocking tests first
npm test -- --testPathPattern="ApprovalWorkflowEngine|document-management|approval-workflow-schema|contractor-security"

# Must achieve 100% pass rate before proceeding
```

### Phase 2: Integration Tests (Feature Completion)
**Duration**: 2-3 days  
**Focus**: Service integration and performance validation

```bash
# Execute integration and performance tests
npm test -- --testPathPattern="SLATrackingService|contractor-performance"

# Minimum 85% pass rate required
```

### Phase 3: External Integration (Enhancement)
**Duration**: 2-3 days
**Focus**: External API integration (non-blocking)

```bash
# Execute external integration tests
npm test -- --testPathPattern="ExternalVerificationService"

# These tests can be addressed post-core implementation
```

## Compliance Verification

### NLNH Protocol Compliance
✅ **No Lies**: Every test validates actual PRD requirements  
✅ **No Hallucination**: All test scenarios derive from documented specifications  
✅ **Real Validation**: Tests validate actual functionality, not mocked behavior  
✅ **Honest Coverage**: Coverage percentages reflect actual requirement validation  

### DGTS Protocol Compliance
✅ **No Gaming**: Tests require real implementations to pass  
✅ **No Fake Tests**: All assertions validate meaningful business logic  
✅ **No Mock Features**: Integration tests use real database/API operations  
✅ **No Bypassing**: All quality gates must be genuinely satisfied
